Dan Leibel is a 23-year-old who lives in New York City. He enjoys creating music and writing short stories, as well as engaging in critical thought and philosophizing with friends. A 2015 graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill, Dan currently works for the City of New York writing press releases, speeches and other media-related documents for the Department of Design and Construction.

In his spare time Dan reads books, hikes, and frequents art museums. He also makes it a priority to see live jazz every Wednesday night at various joints around the city. His favorite jazz artist is Charles Mingus.

Dan launched this site in Spring 2016 as a way to organize and share his creative work with the world.

Special thanks to Reagan Cline for developing the site and to Ed Fountain, the Great.
